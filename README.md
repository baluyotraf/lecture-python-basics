These are scripts to demonstrate the basics of Python programming

## Scripts

The `scripts` folder contains all the scripts, organized by into the following
sections.

### Basic Syntax

These are scripts that show the syntax of a Python instruction. This covers
areas such as the basic syntax, variables, types, and string functions.

### Operators

These covers the built in operators in Python such as arithmetic, assignment,
comparison, boolean, identity, and membership operators

### Collections

These scripts demonstrate the use and difference between different collections
such as list, tuple, set, and dictionary. Comprehension syntax for different
collections are also here.

### Flow Control

These contains ways to change the program flow such as conditional statements,
loops, and in some cases, exceptions.

### Code Organization

These are the concepts that are used to organize one's code. These contain
examples for functions and lambda functions, classes, and modules and
packages.

### IO

The IO section introduces command line inputs as well as text and binary types
of files as input and output.
